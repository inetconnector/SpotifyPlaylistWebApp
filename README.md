# Spotify Playlist Web App â€“ Consolidated README

# Spotify Playlist Web App

## Overview
This ASP.NET Core web application connects to the **Spotify Web API** to automatically generate, clone, and organize playlists based on a user's listening behavior and saved tracks.

The app uses OAuth2 PKCE authentication and communicates with Spotify's API to access private data such as top tracks, saved tracks, and recommendations.

## Main Features (Dashboard Buttons)

| Icon | Action | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| ðŸ“œ | **Clone Liked Songs** | Creates a playlist containing all your saved Spotify songs. |
| ðŸŽ¶ | **Create Alternative Favorites** | Generates a new playlist with alternative tracks from the same artists, avoiding duplicates. |
| âœ¨ | **Create Recommendations** | Uses Spotify recommendations to suggest new songs based on your profile. |
| ðŸ”€ | **Shuffle Liked Songs** | Builds a randomized mix of your liked songs. |
| ðŸ“ˆ | **Most-Listened Songs** | Lists your most frequently played tracks. |

All text and tooltips are localized through `SharedResource.de.resx` and `SharedResource.en.resx`.

### File Structure (Key Components)
```
Controllers/
  HomeController.cs          # Contains all playlist generation actions
Views/

### Data Flow
1. User logs in with Spotify (OAuth2 PKCE).  
2. Access token stored in session.  
3. User triggers an action via a dashboard button.  
4. Controller calls Spotify Web API.  
5. A new playlist is created in the user's account.

## Audiobook & Podcast Filter

A helper function `IsPlayableMusicTrack()` was added to exclude **audiobooks** and **podcasts** from all playlists:
```csharp
if (type.Contains("audiobook") || type.Contains("podcast"))
    return false;
```
This prevents unwanted tracks (e.g., audiobook chapters) from appearing in generated playlists.
