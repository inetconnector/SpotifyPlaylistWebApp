## 🧭 Data Flow

1. User authenticates with Spotify (OAuth 2 PKCE).  
2. Access token is stored temporarily in session.  
3. User triggers playlist creation or export.  
4. The app calls Spotify Web API asynchronously.  
5. Playlist is created in the user’s Spotify library.  
6. (Optional) Playlist is exported to Plex via Plex API using a temporary PIN-based token.

## 🛠️ Spotify + Plex Developer Setup

### 1️⃣ Create Spotify App
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard → **Create App**  
2. Set Redirect URIs:  
   ```
   https://localhost:5001/callback/
   https://yourdomain.com/callback/
   ```
3. Save and copy your **Client ID**.

### 2️⃣ Plex App Setup (for export feature)
The Plex integration uses a temporary PIN system (no permanent secret).  
No configuration needed, but ensure outbound access to:  
`https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins` and `https://plex.tv/api/v2/token`.

---

## 💻 Run Locally

```bash
dotnet restore

```
Then open [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001)

You must be registered as a Spotify tester for your Client ID.
